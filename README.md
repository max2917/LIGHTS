# LIGHTS

This project was entirely for fun and learning on my part. When I started I didn't know how to control hardware, I had never practically used multiple threads before, and I had never done a single thing with networking.

The basic goal was to control WS2812B LEDs from any device in a convenient way. The lights are controlled from a simple web page that is locally hosted on the Raspberry Pi controller for the lights. Currently the lights can be set to any solid static color and a few simple animations.
